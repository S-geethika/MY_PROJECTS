                PROJECT SUMMARY
Generally the students after completing their secondary education have a thought whether the college they want to choose is suitable for them or not. In this project, we presented a model which can recommend the college according to the input given by the student.
The College Administration always wants to interact with their students and make necessary improvements, which is difficult in real world scenario. To solve this, we proposed a model which collects the required data from students, administration, processes the data and provides necessary feedback to the administration. 
Every student wants to know the factors affecting their CGPA so that they can improve themselves for getting better results. So we provided those factors using data mining and a model for predicting cgpa.
We grouped the studentsâ€™ data into certain categories and found deciding attributes for a student (data tuple) to fall into a particular category.
